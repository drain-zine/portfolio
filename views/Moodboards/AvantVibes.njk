The Avant Vibes webpage took two design cues from seemingly disparate design philosophies. The general layout and arguably main theme of the site was minimalism, as utilised by retail sites such as [Supreme](https://www.supremenewyork.com/).

Here, the web designer has opted for a simple, high contrast colour scheme of black, white and red as well as saturated monochrome background photo. This makes the site highly readable, and when paired with the simple layout of the site it draws the viewer's attention to the text content or photo content of the products. One could also draw the connection to this style of design to the physical retail location’s layout schema, opting for a simple uncrowded space where the products themselves are emphasized by the surronding negative spaces.

On the about page we see this strain of design continue, however with the primary content and background colours flipped. This breaks up the website, as well as providing distinct visual signatures for each page served to the user.

In contrast, the second major design cue was from archaic web design practices, notably the use of tables and loud graphics which became popular in the late 90s and early to mid 00s.
One could posit that the popularity of this style was due to the explosion of the web in the early 2000s. With the rise of web development as a profession, as well as software like adobe flash, a growing toolkit was available to designers and amateurs alike. This led to a proliferation of website templates and royalty free assets leading to heavy use of standarised tabular layouts featuring and dynamic elements such as gifs and animations.

Simultaneous to this, digital drawing and CGI software were becoming less expensive and less performance intense. This led to the heavy incorporation of graphic assets and backgrounds on sites, which was coupled with the increased use of bright primary and secondary colours, providing an element of contrast against chromatically busy pages. This was particularly popular among hobbyist and amateur websites, allowing one to create a unique site and potentially show off their own design work. Some elements of this practice were utilised in professional websites, specifically "themed" websites meant to promote products such as games, film and tv or to exist alongside these products as guides or the blossoming "wiki" site.

With this, and the minimalist design practice as explored above in mind, the Avant Vibes website combines these by taking complementary design elements from both. The simple, high-contrast colour schemes and text boxes are taken from the minimalist approach and combined with tables and low contrast or greyscaled 3D renders and assets to provide a unique visual style.

The methodology of nostalgic amatuer webdesign comes to a head on the links page of the site - a page for cataloguing secondary and tertiary content pertaining to the radio show. Here the blend of minimalist layout and colour schemes and busy yet chromatically subdued assets was thrown out in favour of a pure maximalist approach.

Inspiration from sites such as [Yvette’s Bridal](https://yvettesbridalformal.p1r8.net/), [yyyyyyy](https://yyyyyyy.info/) and X was taken, examples of amateur 00s web design taken to its most extreme. Sites such as these have become a cultural meme, one which people collate, compare and catalogue under labels such as nightmare web design.

Whilst incredibly loud sites with almost disorienting levels of dynamism through gifs, marquee and translating elements can lead one to label sites designed like this as nightmarish, one could also look past that surface level shock and find a style of design not to dissimilar to that of the provocative collages of the [Dadaists](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/d/dada) or the psychogeographiques of the [Situationist International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography).

 Where these sites have been lambasted by practically every part of the web design and the mainstream internet community as a whole, their aesthetics and design practices have been mythologised across the nicher parts of the web, from their prominence in [“creepy-pasta” stories](https://odd-websites.fandom.com/wiki/Mortis.com), to use in ppages of [avant-garde artists](https://100gecs.com/) and a whole spectrum of [forums](https://a2b2.org/).
